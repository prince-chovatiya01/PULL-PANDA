**Score:** 8.39/10

## 🤖 AI Review

- Code style: Global variable `_data` is introduced, which contradicts the project's coding standards.
- Suggestion: Remove the global variable and instead pass the data as a parameter or use a more suitable design pattern.

- Bug: The `get_weather_data` function may throw an exception if the file 'sample_weather.json' is not found or cannot be loaded.
- Suggestion: Add error handling for file operations and consider using a more robust way to load the data, such as using a caching mechanism.

- Code smell: The `get_weather_data` function is doing two separate things: loading data from a file and fetching weather data for a city.
- Suggestion: Break down the function into smaller, more focused functions, each with a single responsibility.

- Test: No unit tests are included in the PR to verify the new logic.
- Suggestion: Add unit tests to cover the new functionality and ensure it works as expected.
