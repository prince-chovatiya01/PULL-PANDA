**Code Review**

The provided GitHub Pull Request diff contains several new files and functions. Here's a review of the code, pointing out bugs, mistakes, and suggestions:

### README.md

* The file is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the calculator project.
* The usage example is helpful, but it would be better to include more examples or a link to a documentation page.

### auth.py

* **Security issue**: The `login` function uses plain text password comparison, which is insecure. The `secure_login` function is an improvement, but it's still not recommended to store passwords using SHA-256 without a salt.
* Consider using a library like `bcrypt` or `passlib` for secure password hashing.
* The `secure_login` function assumes that the stored hash is for the password "admin123". In a real-world scenario, you would need to store the hashed password for each user separately.

### calculator_2.py

* The calculator functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `power`, and `sqrt`) are well-implemented and handle edge cases correctly.
* Consider adding more functions for other mathematical operations, such as logarithms or trigonometric functions.
* The `divide` function raises a `ValueError` when dividing by zero, which is correct. However, you might want to consider returning a special value (like `float('inf')`) instead of raising an exception.

### data_processor.py

* The `process_data` function is inefficient and can be improved using list comprehension, as shown in the `process_data_optimized` function.
* The `process_large_dataset` function is a good addition, as it allows for batch processing of large datasets.
* Consider adding more functions for data processing, such as filtering or grouping.

### sort_algorithms.py

* The `bubble_sort` function is implemented correctly, but it's not the most efficient sorting algorithm.
* The `quick_sort` function is also implemented correctly, but it's not stable (i.e., it may change the order of equal elements).
* The `merge_sort` function is a good addition, as it's a stable and efficient sorting algorithm.
* The `merge` function is not fully implemented, as it's missing the handling of the remaining elements in the `left` and `right` lists.

**Suggestions**

* Consider adding more tests for each function to ensure they work correctly.
* Use a consistent naming convention throughout the code (e.g., use either camelCase or underscore notation).
* Add more documentation to each function to explain what it does, what inputs it expects, and what outputs it returns.
* Consider using a linter or code formatter to improve code readability and consistency.

**Bugs and Mistakes**

* The `auth.py` file has a security issue with plain text password comparison.
* The `merge` function in `sort_algorithms.py` is not fully implemented.
* There are no tests for any of the functions, which makes it difficult to ensure they work correctly.
* The code uses inconsistent naming conventions and indentation.
