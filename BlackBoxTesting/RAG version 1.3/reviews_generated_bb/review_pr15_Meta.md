## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary:** This PR updates `user_utils.py` but introduces new issues, including missing type hints, incorrect import usage, and formatting inconsistencies. 

**Critical Bugs:**
1. The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing type hints.
2. The `format_user_for_display` function is missing type hints and does not follow the coding standards.
3. The `is_admin` function hardcodes the 'admin' string, which is bad practice.
4. The `validate_email` function is a weak validator.

**Important Improvements:**
1. Improve the `validate_email` function to use a stronger validation method, such as a regular expression.
2. Replace the hardcoded 'admin' string in `is_admin` with a configurable value.
3. Add proper error handling to the `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions.

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
1. Run `black` to format the code according to the coding standards.
2. Add missing type hints to all functions.
3. Remove unused imports (e.g., `requests` in `user_utils.py`).
4. Address Pylint, Flake8, and Mypy issues, including missing module and function docstrings.

**Tests & CI:**
1. Add unit tests for the new `format_user_for_display` function.
2. Include tests for edge cases in the `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions.

**Positive notes:**
1. The PR attempts to add a new function `format_user_for_display` to handle user display formatting.
2. The code is generally well-structured, but needs refinement to meet the coding standards. 

To address the issues, consider the following actionable steps:
- Refactor `is_admin` to use a configurable admin role.
- Enhance `validate_email` using a stronger validation method.
- Add type hints to all functions.
- Run `black` for code formatting.
- Remove unused imports.
- Address all static analysis issues.
- Add unit tests for new logic and edge cases.

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
