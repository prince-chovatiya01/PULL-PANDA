## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary:** This PR updates the `api_client.py` file, improving error handling and adding type hints, but has issues with file detection and formatting.

**Critical Bugs:**
1. **File not found**: The static analysis tools (Pylint, Flake8, Bandit, Mypy) are unable to find the `api_client.py` file, indicating a potential issue with the file path or repository structure.
2. **Missing timeout**: The `get_user_data` function is missing a timeout for the API request, which can cause the function to hang indefinitely.

**Important Improvements:**
1. **Add timeout**: Add a timeout to the `get_user_data` function to prevent it from hanging indefinitely.
2. **Improve error handling**: While the `get_user_data` function now catches `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`, it should also handle other potential exceptions, such as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
3. **Refactor `get_post_data`**: Update the `get_post_data` function to include type hints and a configurable timeout.

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
1. **Run `black` for formatting**: The code does not conform to the standard formatting, run `black` to ensure consistency.
2. **Add docstrings**: While some functions have docstrings, they should be updated to include information about arguments, return values, and raised exceptions.
3. **Avoid global variables**: The `BASE_URL` variable is defined globally, consider passing it as an argument to the functions that use it.

**Tests & CI:**
1. **Add unit tests**: Include unit tests for the updated functions to ensure they behave as expected.
2. **Verify CI pipeline**: Confirm that the CI pipeline is correctly configured to run the static analysis tools and unit tests.

**Positive notes:**
1. **Improved error handling**: The `get_user_data` function now catches and handles `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`, which is a significant improvement.
2. **Added type hints**: The functions now include type hints, which improves code readability and maintainability.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
