## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR introduces new functionality to `user_utils.py` but has several issues that need to be addressed, including missing type hints, incorrect formatting, and lack of unit tests.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **File not found errors**: The static analysis tools are reporting that `user_utils.py` cannot be found. Ensure the file is correctly committed and the path is correct.
2. **Missing type hints**: Multiple functions (`get_full_name`, `validate_email`, `format_user_for_display`) are missing type hints, which is against the coding standards.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Use `black` for formatting**: The code is not formatted according to the coding standards. Run `black` on the file to ensure consistent formatting.
2. **Improve email validation**: The current email validation is weak and can be improved to handle more cases.
3. **Add docstrings**: While some functions have docstrings, they are incomplete or missing information about returns and raises.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Avoid implicit state**: The `format_user_for_display` function assumes the existence of `user_obj.first`, `user_obj.last`, and `user_obj.email`. Consider passing these explicitly or using a more robust data structure.
2. **Naming conventions**: Ensure that all functions and variables follow the coding standards for naming conventions.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Add unit tests**: There are no unit tests for the new functionality. Add tests to cover all functions and edge cases.
2. **Fix flakiness**: The static analysis tools are reporting errors due to the file not being found. Ensure that the tests are running correctly and not flaky.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Type hints in some functions**: The `is_admin` function has correct type hints, which is a good practice.
2. **Attempt at formatting**: The code has some attempt at formatting, but it needs to be consistent with the coding standards.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
