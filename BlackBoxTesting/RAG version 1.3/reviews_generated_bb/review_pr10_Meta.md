## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR modifies the `user_utils.py` file, updating the `is_admin` function and removing docstrings. However, it introduces issues with type hints, formatting, and static analysis.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **File not found**: The static analysis tools are unable to find the `user_utils.py` file, indicating a potential issue with the file path or repository structure.
2. **Type hints**: The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing type hints, violating the coding standards.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Security**: The `is_admin` function still hardcodes the 'admin' string, which is bad practice. Consider using a more secure approach, such as storing the admin role in a configuration file or environment variable.
2. **Performance**: The `validate_email` function uses a weak validation approach. Consider using a more robust email validation library.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Formatting**: The code does not follow the `black` formatting standard. Run `black` on the `user_utils.py` file to ensure consistent formatting.
2. **Docstrings**: The PR removes docstrings from the functions. Add docstrings to explain the purpose, arguments, return values, and raised exceptions for each function.
3. **Naming**: The function names are clear, but consider using more descriptive names to improve readability.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Missing tests**: There are no unit tests for the modified functions. Add unit tests to ensure the functions behave as expected.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Improved `is_admin` function**: The PR updates the `is_admin` function to use the `lower()` method, making it more robust.
2. **Code simplification**: The PR simplifies the code by removing unnecessary comments and lines.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
