## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR refactors the `api_client.py` file, improving error handling and adding timeouts. However, it introduces issues with static analysis and lacks proper testing.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **Static analysis errors**: The PR diff and static analysis results indicate that the file `api_client.py` is not found. This needs to be resolved before merging.
2. **Broad exception handling**: The `get_user_data` function catches a broad `Exception` which can mask other issues. It should be narrowed down to specific exceptions.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Error handling**: The PR improves error handling by adding `response.raise_for_status()` and logging errors. However, it can be further improved by handling specific exceptions.
2. **Timeouts**: The PR adds timeouts to API requests, which is a good practice.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Type hints**: The PR maintains type hints for function parameters and return types, which is good.
2. **Docstrings**: The PR removes docstrings for functions. These should be added back to explain the purpose, parameters, and return values of each function.
3. **Formatting**: The PR does not appear to use `black` for formatting, as per the coding standards. The code should be formatted using `black`.
4. **Global variables**: The PR uses a global variable `BASE_URL`. This should be passed explicitly or loaded from an environment variable.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Missing tests**: The PR does not include unit tests for the new logic. Tests should be added to cover the API request and error handling scenarios.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Improved error handling**: The PR improves error handling by adding timeouts and logging errors.
2. **Simplified code**: The PR simplifies the code by removing unnecessary comments and lines.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
