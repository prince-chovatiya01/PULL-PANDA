## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR refactors user utility functions, but introduces issues with file handling and code quality. 
It requires significant revisions before merge.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **File not found errors**: The PR diff and static analysis results indicate that the file `user_utils.py` is not found. Ensure the file exists and is correctly referenced.
2. **Type hints and docstrings**: The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing type hints, and the `get_initials` function is missing a docstring.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Security**: The `validate_email` function is a weak validator and may allow malicious input. Consider using a more robust validation library.
2. **Performance**: The `is_admin` function uses a hardcoded string, which may not be efficient. Consider using a more dynamic approach.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Formatting**: The code does not follow the `black` formatting standard. Run `black` on the code to ensure consistency.
2. **Global variables**: Although not present in this diff, ensure that the code avoids global variables and passes state explicitly.
3. **Function naming**: Function names like `get_full_name` and `get_initials` are clear, but consider making them more descriptive.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Missing tests**: There are no unit tests for the new `get_initials` function. Add tests to ensure the function works correctly.
2. **Flakiness**: The `validate_email` function may return incorrect results for certain inputs. Consider adding tests to ensure the function is robust.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Type hints**: The `is_admin` function has correct type hints, which is good practice.
2. **Functionality**: The `get_initials` function is a useful addition to the codebase.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
