## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR updates the `api_client.py` file, improving error handling and adding timeouts to API requests. However, it introduces issues with file detection and lacks proper testing.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **File not found errors**: The static analysis tools (Pylint, Flake8, Bandit, Mypy) are unable to find the `api_client.py` file, indicating a potential issue with the file path or repository structure. **Action**: Verify the file path and repository structure to ensure the file is correctly located and accessible.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Error handling**: The `get_user_data` function now uses `response.raise_for_status()` to handle HTTP errors, but it catches a broad `Exception` which may mask other issues. **Action**: Consider catching specific exceptions (e.g., `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`) to handle different error scenarios.
2. **Timeouts**: The PR adds timeouts to API requests, which is a good practice. **Action**: Consider making the timeout values configurable to accommodate different use cases.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Type hints**: The `get_post_data` function is missing type hints for its return value. **Action**: Add type hints for the return value of `get_post_data`.
2. **Docstrings**: The `get_post_data` function is missing a docstring. **Action**: Add a docstring to explain the purpose, arguments, return values, and any raised exceptions for `get_post_data`.
3. **Static analysis**: The PR should be updated to pass the static analysis checks. **Action**: Address the file not found errors and ensure the code is formatted according to the coding standards (e.g., using `black`).

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Missing tests**: There are no unit tests for the new logic in the PR. **Action**: Add unit tests to cover the updated functions, including error handling and timeout scenarios.
2. **Flakiness**: The broad `Exception` catch in `get_user_data` may lead to flaky tests. **Action**: Consider using more specific exception handling to reduce test flakiness.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Improved error handling**: The PR updates the `get_user_data` function to handle errors more robustly.
2. **Added timeouts**: The PR adds timeouts to API requests, which improves the overall reliability of the code.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
