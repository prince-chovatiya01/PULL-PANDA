## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary:** This PR updates the `api_client.py` file, improving error handling and adding type hints, but has issues with file detection and formatting.

**Critical Bugs:**
1. **File not found**: The static analysis tools are unable to find the `api_client.py` file, indicating a potential issue with the file path or commit.
2. **Missing timeout**: The `get_user_data` function is missing a timeout for the API request.

**Important Improvements:**
1. **Add timeouts**: Set timeouts for API requests to prevent indefinite waits.
2. **Error handling**: Improve error handling by logging specific error messages and returning informative error responses.

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
1. **Run `black` for formatting**: The code does not conform to the standard formatting, run `black` to fix indentation and spacing issues.
2. **Add docstrings**: Public functions like `get_post_data` are missing docstrings, add them to explain the function's purpose, arguments, return values, and raised exceptions.
3. **Avoid global variables**: The `BASE_URL` variable is defined globally, consider passing it as an argument to the functions that use it.

**Tests & CI:**
1. **Add unit tests**: Include unit tests for the new logic and error handling to ensure the functions behave as expected.

**Positive notes:**
1. **Improved error handling**: The PR adds better error handling, including logging and returning informative error responses.
2. **Added type hints**: The `get_user_data` function now has type hints, improving code readability and maintainability.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
