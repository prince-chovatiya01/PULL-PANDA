## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR modifies the `user_utils.py` file, updating the `is_admin` function and removing docstrings. However, it introduces issues with type hints, formatting, and static analysis errors.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **Static analysis errors**: The PR causes fatal errors in Pylint, Flake8, and Mypy due to a missing file. Ensure the file exists and is correctly referenced.
2. **Type hints**: The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing type hints. Add type hints for function parameters and return types.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Security**: The `is_admin` function still hardcodes the 'admin' string. Consider using a more secure approach, such as retrieving the admin role from a configuration file or database.
2. **Performance**: The `validate_email` function uses a basic validation approach. Consider using a more robust email validation library.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Formatting**: The code does not follow the `black` formatting standard. Run `black` on the code to ensure consistent formatting.
2. **Docstrings**: The PR removes docstrings from functions. Add docstrings to explain function parameters, return values, and raised exceptions.
3. **Naming**: Function names are clear, but variable names could be improved. Consider using more descriptive variable names.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Missing tests**: There are no unit tests for the modified functions. Add unit tests to ensure the functions behave correctly.
2. **Flakiness**: The PR does not address potential flakiness in the tests. Consider adding tests to handle edge cases and ensure consistent test results.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Improved `is_admin` function**: The PR updates the `is_admin` function to use `user_role.lower()`, making it more robust.
2. **Code simplification**: The PR simplifies the code by removing unnecessary comments and code.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
