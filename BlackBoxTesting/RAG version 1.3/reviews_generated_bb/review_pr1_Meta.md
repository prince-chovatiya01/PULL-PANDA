## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR updates the `config_loader.py` file to handle `FileNotFoundError` when loading configuration files. However, it introduces issues with static analysis and code quality.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **Static analysis errors**: The PR causes fatal errors in Pylint, Flake8, Bandit, and Mypy due to a missing file. Ensure the file exists and is correctly referenced.
2. **Incorrect error handling**: Instead of printing an error message and exiting, consider raising a custom exception to handle the `FileNotFoundError` more robustly.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Add unit tests**: Include tests for the updated `load_config` function to ensure it handles different scenarios correctly.
2. **Improve docstrings**: Update docstrings to reflect the changes in the `load_config` function and include information about the raised exception.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Run `black` for formatting**: The code does not conform to the specified formatting standards. Run `black` to ensure consistent formatting.
2. **Avoid using `sys.exit`**: Instead of using `sys.exit`, consider raising an exception to handle errors more elegantly.
3. **Type hints for exceptions**: Add type hints for the exceptions that can be raised by the `load_config` function.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Add tests for error scenarios**: Include tests to cover the `FileNotFoundError` scenario and ensure the function behaves as expected.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Improved error handling**: The PR introduces error handling for `FileNotFoundError`, which is a good practice.
2. **Type hints**: The code includes type hints for function parameters and return types, which improves code readability and maintainability.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
