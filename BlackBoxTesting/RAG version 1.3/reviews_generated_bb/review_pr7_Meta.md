## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR updates the `api_client.py` file, improving error handling and adding timeouts to API requests. However, it introduces issues with static analysis and code quality.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **Static analysis errors**: The PR diff and static analysis results indicate that the file `api_client.py` is not found. This needs to be resolved before merge.
2. **Broad exception handling**: The `get_user_data` function catches a broad `Exception` which can mask specific issues. It should be narrowed down to specific exceptions.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Error handling**: The `get_user_data` function now uses `response.raise_for_status()` which is an improvement. However, it still lacks proper error handling for specific exceptions.
2. **Timeouts**: Timeouts have been added to API requests which improves performance and prevents indefinite waits.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Type hints**: The code is missing type hints for the `get_post_data` function. Add type hints for function parameters and return types.
2. **Docstrings**: The `get_post_data` function is missing a docstring. Add a docstring explaining the function's purpose, parameters, return values, and raised exceptions.
3. **Formatting**: The code should be formatted using `black` to adhere to the engineering coding standards.
4. **Global variables**: The `BASE_URL` variable is defined globally. Consider passing it as a parameter to the functions or using a configuration file.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Missing unit tests**: There are no unit tests for the new logic in the `get_user_data` function. Add unit tests to cover different scenarios and error cases.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Improved error handling**: The PR introduces improved error handling and timeouts for API requests.
2. **Simplified code**: The code has been simplified by removing unnecessary comments and code blocks.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
