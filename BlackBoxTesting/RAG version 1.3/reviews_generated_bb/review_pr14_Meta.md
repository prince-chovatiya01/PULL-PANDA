## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR refactors user utility functions, but introduces issues with formatting, type hints, and documentation. 
**Critical Bugs**: 
* The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing type hints.
* The `get_initials` function is missing a docstring.
* The PR diff is not formatted according to the `black` standard.

**Important Improvements**: 
* The `is_admin` function should be improved to avoid hardcoding the 'admin' string.
* The `validate_email` function should be strengthened to provide better email validation.
* The `get_initials` function should include input validation.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**: 
* The code should be reformatted using `black` to adhere to the coding standards.
* The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions should include type hints for all parameters.
* The `get_initials` function should include a docstring explaining its purpose, parameters, and return values.
* Static analysis results indicate that the file `user_utils.py` is not being found, suggesting a potential issue with the file path or name.

**Tests & CI**: 
* Unit tests should be added for the new `get_initials` function.
* Existing tests should be reviewed to ensure they cover all scenarios.

**Positive notes**: 
* The PR attempts to refactor and improve existing functions.
* Type hints have been added to some functions, such as `is_admin` and `get_initials`. 

Actionable suggestions:
1. Reformat the code using `black`.
2. Add type hints to `get_full_name` and `validate_email`.
3. Add a docstring to `get_initials`.
4. Improve the `is_admin` function to avoid hardcoding.
5. Strengthen the `validate_email` function.
6. Add input validation to `get_initials`.
7. Add unit tests for `get_initials`.
8. Verify the file path and name for `user_utils.py` to resolve static analysis issues.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
