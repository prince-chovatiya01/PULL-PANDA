## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR refactors `user_utils.py` but introduces issues with file detection and formatting. 
It also adds a new function `get_initials` but lacks a docstring.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **File not found errors**: The static analysis tools (Pylint, Flake8, Bandit, Mypy) are unable to find the `user_utils.py` file, indicating a potential issue with the file path or repository structure. Verify the file location and update the tools' configurations if necessary.
2. **Incomplete function implementations**: The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing type hints, and `get_initials` lacks a docstring. Update these functions to comply with the coding standards.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Type hints and docstrings**: Ensure all functions have type hints and docstrings explaining arguments, returns, and raises.
2. **Email validation**: Enhance the `validate_email` function to use a more robust validation method, such as a regular expression.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Run `black` for formatting**: The code does not adhere to the standard formatting. Run `black` to ensure consistent formatting throughout the file.
2. **Avoid hardcoded values**: The `is_admin` function hardcodes the 'admin' string. Consider making this value configurable or using an enumeration.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Add unit tests**: Include unit tests for the new `get_initials` function and any existing functions that lack tests.
2. **Verify test coverage**: Ensure the tests cover all scenarios, including edge cases.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Added new function**: The `get_initials` function is a useful addition to the utility module.
2. **Refactored code**: The PR attempts to simplify and improve the existing code.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
