## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary:** This PR updates the `config_loader.py` file to handle `FileNotFoundError` when loading configuration files. 
However, it introduces some issues that need to be addressed before merging.

**Critical Bugs:**
1. The `load_config` function now prints an error message and exits the program if the config file is not found. Instead, it should raise a meaningful exception to handle this situation.
2. The `get_setting` function does not check if the `config` dictionary is `None` before trying to retrieve a setting from it.

**Important Improvements:**
1. The `load_config` function should specify the encoding when opening the file to avoid potential issues.
2. The `get_setting` function can be improved by adding type hints for the `default` parameter.

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
1. The `config_loader.py` file is missing a module docstring.
2. The `load_config` and `get_setting` functions are missing docstrings.
3. The code does not follow the `black` formatting style, as reported by Flake8 (e.g., `E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1`).
4. The line `config_loader.py:11:80: E501 line too long (80 > 79 characters)` should be addressed by wrapping the line to adhere to the 79-character limit.

**Tests & CI:**
1. There are no unit tests for the updated `load_config` function.
2. The existing tests should be updated to cover the new error handling behavior.

**Positive notes:**
1. The PR is relatively small and focused.
2. The code uses type hints for function parameters and return types.
3. The `mypy` static analysis did not find any issues. 

To address the issues mentioned above, the following actions should be taken:
- Update the `load_config` function to raise a meaningful exception instead of printing an error message and exiting.
- Add a check in the `get_setting` function to handle the case where the `config` dictionary is `None`.
- Add module and function docstrings to the `config_loader.py` file.
- Run `black` to format the code according to the project's standards.
- Address the line length issue reported by Flake8.
- Add unit tests for the updated `load_config` function and update existing tests to cover the new error handling behavior.
