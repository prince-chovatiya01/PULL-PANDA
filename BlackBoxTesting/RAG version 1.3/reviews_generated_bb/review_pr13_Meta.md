# Review for PR #13 (Prompt: Meta)
**Score:** 7.9/10

---

## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary:** 
The PR introduces changes to `api_client.py`, improving error handling and adding a `response.raise_for_status()` call. However, it still lacks proper timeout handling and has other issues.

**Critical Bugs:**
1. **Missing timeout**: The `get_user_data` function is missing a timeout, which can cause the program to hang indefinitely.
2. **Incomplete error handling**: The `get_user_data` function only catches `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`, but does not handle other potential exceptions.
3. **Missing response status code check**: The `get_user_data` function does not check the response status code.

**Important Improvements:**
1. **Add timeout to `get_user_data`**: Set a reasonable timeout (e.g., 10 seconds) to prevent the program from hanging indefinitely.
2. **Improve error handling**: Catch and handle specific exceptions (e.g., `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, `requests.exceptions.Timeout`) and provide more informative error messages.
3. **Add response status code check**: Check the response status code and handle potential errors (e.g., 404, 500).

**Code Quality & Maintainability:**
1. **Fix import order**: Move the `logging` import above the `requests` import to follow PEP 8 conventions.
2. **Add type hints**: Add type hints for the `get_post_data` function and the `get_full_name` function in `user_utils.py`.
3. **Use lazy % formatting in logging**: Update logging statements to use lazy % formatting (e.g., `logging.error(f"API request failed: {e}")`).
4. **Address static analysis issues**: Fix issues reported by Pylint, Flake8, and Bandit, such as missing docstrings, incorrect import order, and missing timeouts.

**Tests & CI:**
1. **Add tests for error handling**: Write tests to ensure that the `get_user_data` function handles errors correctly (e.g., timeouts, connection errors).
2. **Add tests for response status code checks**: Write tests to ensure that the `get_user_data` function checks the response status code correctly.

**Positive notes:**
1. **Improved error handling**: The PR adds a `response.raise_for_status()` call, which is a good practice.
2. **Added logging**: The PR adds logging statements to handle errors, which is helpful for debugging.

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
