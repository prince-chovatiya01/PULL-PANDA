## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR updates the `config_loader.py` file to handle `FileNotFoundError` when loading configuration files. However, it introduces issues with static analysis and code quality.

**Critical Bugs**:
1. **Static analysis errors**: The PR causes errors in Pylint, Flake8, Bandit, and Mypy due to a missing file. Ensure the file exists and is properly formatted.
2. **Inconsistent error handling**: The `load_config` function now handles `FileNotFoundError`, but other potential errors (e.g., `JSONDecodeError`) are not handled. Implement comprehensive error handling.

**Important Improvements**:
1. **Add unit tests**: Include tests for the updated `load_config` function to ensure it handles different scenarios correctly.
2. **Improve docstrings**: Update docstrings to reflect the new error handling behavior and include information about raised exceptions.
3. **Avoid using `sys.exit`**: Instead of exiting the program directly, consider raising a custom exception to handle errors more elegantly.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. **Run `black` for formatting**: The code does not conform to the specified formatting standards. Run `black` to ensure consistent formatting.
2. **Type hints for all functions**: Verify that all functions have proper type hints, including the `get_setting` function.
3. **Avoid global variables**: Although not introduced in this PR, review the code to ensure that global variables are not used elsewhere.

**Tests & CI**:
1. **Add tests for error scenarios**: Include tests to cover different error scenarios, such as `FileNotFoundError` and `JSONDecodeError`.
2. **Verify test coverage**: Ensure that the updated code has adequate test coverage to prevent regressions.

**Positive notes**:
1. **Improved error handling**: The PR introduces error handling for `FileNotFoundError`, which is a step in the right direction.
2. **Simplified code**: The updated `load_config` function is more concise and easier to read.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
