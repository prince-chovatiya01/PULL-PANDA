## 🤖 AI Review

**Summary**: This PR updates the `user_utils.py` file with new functionality, but it has several issues that need to be addressed. 

**Critical Bugs**:
1. The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing type hints.
2. The `format_user_for_display` function is missing type hints and a docstring.
3. The `is_admin` function hardcodes the 'admin' string, which is bad practice.

**Important Improvements**:
1. The email validation in `validate_email` is weak and should be improved for better security.
2. The `format_user_for_display` function uses `user_obj.first` and `user_obj.last`, but it's unclear where these attributes come from; consider adding a check or using a more robust data structure.

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
1. The code does not follow the `black` formatting standard; run `black` on the file to fix formatting issues.
2. The `get_full_name` and `validate_email` functions are missing docstrings; add docstrings to explain the purpose, arguments, return values, and any raised exceptions.
3. Consider using a more robust data structure, such as a `dataclass` or a `namedtuple`, to represent user objects.

**Tests & CI**:
1. There are no unit tests for the new `format_user_for_display` function; add tests to cover this functionality.
2. The existing functions (`is_admin`, `get_full_name`, `validate_email`) should also have unit tests to ensure they work correctly.

**Positive notes**:
1. The PR is relatively small and focused, which is good practice.
2. The code uses type hints in some places, which is a good start; just needs to be consistent throughout the file. 

To address the static analysis issues, ensure that the `user_utils.py` file exists in the correct location and is properly formatted. The `mypy`, `pylint`, `flake8`, and `bandit` tools are all reporting errors due to the file not being found or being empty. 

Actionable steps:
- Run `black` on the file to fix formatting issues.
- Add type hints and docstrings to all functions.
- Improve the email validation in `validate_email`.
- Add unit tests for the new `format_user_for_display` function and existing functions.
- Consider using a more robust data structure to represent user objects.

## 🧠 Retrieved RAG Context

# Our Engineering Coding Standards

## Python
- All functions must have type hints.
- Use `black` for formatting.
- All public functions must have a docstring explaining args, returns, and raises.
- Avoid global variables. Pass state explicitly.

## General
- PRs should be small and focused.
- Always include unit tests for new logic.
- Do not commit secrets. Use .env files.
