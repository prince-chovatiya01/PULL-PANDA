Here are the reviews for the provided diff:

**README.md**
- Code style: Missing newline at the end of the file.
- Suggestion: Add a newline at the end of the file for consistency.

**auth.py**
- Security: Plain text password comparison in `login` function.
- Suggestion: Remove the `login` function and use the `secure_login` function instead, which uses hashing for password comparison.
- Code style: Inconsistent naming convention for functions (`login` vs `secure_login`).
- Suggestion: Rename `secure_login` to `login` for consistency.

**calculator_2.py**
- Bug: No input validation for `add`, `subtract`, and `multiply` functions.
- Suggestion: Add input validation to check for non-numeric inputs.
- Code style: Missing newline at the end of the file.
- Suggestion: Add a newline at the end of the file for consistency.

**data_processor.py**
- Performance: Inefficient processing in `process_data` function.
- Suggestion: Remove the `process_data` function and use the `process_data_optimized` function instead, which uses list comprehension for better performance.
- Code style: Missing newline at the end of the file.
- Suggestion: Add a newline at the end of the file for consistency.

**sort_algorithms.py**
- Bug: Missing implementation for `merge` function call in `merge_sort`.
- Suggestion: Complete the implementation of the `merge` function call in `merge_sort`.
- Code style: Missing newline at the end of the file.
- Suggestion: Add a newline at the end of the file for consistency.
