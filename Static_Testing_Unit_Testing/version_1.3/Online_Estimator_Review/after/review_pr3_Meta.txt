**Summary**: This PR introduces a new database schema using SQLAlchemy 2.0 style with type annotations, replacing the old SQLAlchemy 1.3 style. It also adds indexes for better query performance.

**Critical Bugs**:
* The file is missing a newline at the end, which can cause issues with some tools and compilers (add a newline at the end of the file).
* The `Index` class is not imported, which will cause a `NameError` (add `from sqlalchemy import Index` at the top of the file).

**Important Improvements**:
* Consider adding a `__repr__` method to the `User` class for better debugging and logging (e.g., `def __repr__(self): return f"User(id={self.id}, username={self.username}, email={self.email})"`).

**Code Quality & Maintainability**:
* The code has some duplication between the old and new styles, consider removing the old style code to simplify the file (remove lines 1-14).
* The `Base` class can be removed and replaced with `DeclarativeBase` directly (replace `class Base(DeclarativeBase): pass` with `Base = DeclarativeBase()`).

**Tests & CI**:
* No tests are included in this PR, consider adding tests to verify the correctness of the schema and indexes.

**Positive notes**:
* The PR uses type annotations, which improves code readability and maintainability.
* The addition of indexes can significantly improve query performance.
