**Review of GitHub Pull Request Diff**

### Overview

The provided diff is for a new `README.md` file in a Calculator Project repository. The file describes a simple calculator library with basic arithmetic operations.

### Bugs and Mistakes

1. **Inconsistent Function Listing**: The `## Available Functions` section lists four functions: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`. However, the `## Usage` section only demonstrates the usage of `add` and `subtract` functions. It would be better to include examples for all listed functions.
2. **Lack of Error Handling**: The `divide` function is prone to a `ZeroDivisionError` when the divisor is zero. It would be a good practice to mention how the library handles such errors or provide an example of how to handle them.
3. **No Import Statement for `multiply` and `divide`**: The `## Usage` section only imports `add` and `subtract` functions from the `calculator` module. To use `multiply` and `divide` functions, they should also be imported.

### Suggestions

1. **Add Examples for All Functions**: Include usage examples for `multiply` and `divide` functions in the `## Usage` section.
2. **Mention Error Handling**: Provide information on how the library handles potential errors, such as division by zero.
3. **Complete Import Statement**: Update the import statement to include all available functions: `from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide`.
4. **Consider Adding a Section for Installation or Setup**: If the library requires specific installation or setup steps, consider adding a section to guide users through the process.
5. **Use a Consistent Code Block Format**: The code block in the `## Usage` section uses Markdown syntax. Consider using a consistent format throughout the README file.

### Updated `README.md` Example

```markdown
# Calculator Project

A simple calculator library for basic arithmetic operations.

## Available Functions

* `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers
* `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference between two numbers
* `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of two numbers
* `divide(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of two numbers

## Usage

```python
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

result_add = add(5, 3)  # Returns 8
result_subtract = subtract(5, 3)  # Returns 2
result_multiply = multiply(5, 3)  # Returns 15
result_divide = divide(6, 3)  # Returns 2.0

# Error handling example
try:
    result_divide_by_zero = divide(6, 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")
```

## Error Handling

The `divide` function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` when the divisor is zero. You can handle this error using a try-except block as shown in the example above.
