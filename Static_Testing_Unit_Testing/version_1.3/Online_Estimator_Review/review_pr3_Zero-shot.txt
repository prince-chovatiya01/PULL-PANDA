**Review of the GitHub Pull Request Diff**

### Overall Impression

The diff introduces a new file `database_schema.py` that defines a database schema using SQLAlchemy. The schema includes a `User` table with columns for `id`, `username`, `email`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. The code is well-structured and follows best practices.

### Bugs and Mistakes

1. **Missing Import**: The `Index` class is used in the `__table_args__` attribute, but it is not imported. Add `from sqlalchemy import Index` to the imports.
2. **Inconsistent Style**: The code mixes SQLAlchemy 1.3 and 2.0 styles. It is recommended to stick to a single style throughout the codebase. Since the code is using SQLAlchemy 2.0 style with type annotations, it is better to remove the old style code.
3. **No Newline at End of File**: The file is missing a newline character at the end. This is not a bug, but it is a good practice to include a newline character at the end of each file.
4. **Redundant `String` Type**: In the SQLAlchemy 2.0 style, the `String` type is not needed when using `mapped_column`. Remove the `String` type from the `username` and `email` columns.

### Suggestions

1. **Use Consistent Naming Conventions**: The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable names. It is recommended to stick to a single convention throughout the codebase. In Python, the convention is to use underscore notation.
2. **Add Docstrings**: Add docstrings to the `User` class and its methods to provide a description of the class and its purpose.
3. **Consider Adding a `__repr__` Method**: Add a `__repr__` method to the `User` class to provide a string representation of the object.
4. **Use Type Hints for `datetime`**: Use type hints for the `datetime` type to specify the expected type of the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns.

### Updated Code

```python
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column
from sqlalchemy import Index
from datetime import datetime

class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

class User(Base):
    """
    Represents a user in the database.
    """
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    username: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(length=50, nullable=False)
    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(length=100, nullable=False)
    created_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at: Mapped[datetime] = mapped_column(
        default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow
    )
    
    __table_args__ = (
        Index('ix_users_email', 'email', unique=True),
        Index('ix_users_username', 'username', unique=True)
    )

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"User(id={self.id}, username={self.username}, email={self.email})"
```

Note: The updated code removes the old style code and uses only the SQLAlchemy 2.0 style with type annotations. It also adds docstrings and a `__repr__` method to the `User` class.
