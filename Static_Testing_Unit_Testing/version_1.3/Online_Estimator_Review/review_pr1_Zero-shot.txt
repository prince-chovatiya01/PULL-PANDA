### Review of GitHub Pull Request Diff

The provided diff is for a new `README.md` file in a calculator project. Here's a review of the diff, pointing out potential bugs, mistakes, and suggestions:

#### Bugs and Mistakes:

1. **Incomplete Usage Example**: The usage example only includes `add` and `subtract` functions, but the available functions section lists `multiply` and `divide` as well. It would be beneficial to include examples for all available functions.
2. **No Error Handling**: The `divide` function may raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the second argument is zero. It's essential to handle this case and provide a meaningful error message.
3. **No Input Validation**: The functions do not validate their inputs. For example, they assume that the inputs are numbers, but they do not check for this. Adding input validation would make the functions more robust.

#### Suggestions:

1. **Add More Detailed Documentation**: Consider adding more detailed documentation for each function, including their parameters, return values, and any exceptions they may raise.
2. **Include a License**: It's a good practice to include a license in the `README.md` file to specify the terms under which the project can be used.
3. **Provide Installation Instructions**: If the project is intended to be used as a library, provide instructions on how to install it using pip or another package manager.
4. **Consider Adding a `main` Function**: If the project is intended to be used as a standalone calculator, consider adding a `main` function that provides a command-line interface for the calculator.

#### Updated Usage Example:

To address the incomplete usage example, the updated `README.md` file could include examples for all available functions:
```python
## Usage
```python
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

result_add = add(5, 3)  # Returns 8
result_subtract = subtract(5, 3)  # Returns 2
result_multiply = multiply(5, 3)  # Returns 15
result_divide = divide(5, 3)  # Returns 1.6666666666666667
```

#### Updated Code:

To address the potential bugs and mistakes, the updated code could include input validation and error handling:
```python
def add(a, b):
    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    """Returns the difference between two numbers."""
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    """Returns the product of two numbers."""
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    """Returns the quotient of two numbers."""
    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError("Both inputs must be numbers")
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b
