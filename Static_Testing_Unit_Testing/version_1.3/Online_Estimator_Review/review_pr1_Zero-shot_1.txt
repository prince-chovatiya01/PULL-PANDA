**Review of GitHub Pull Request Diff**

### Overview

The provided diff introduces a new `README.md` file for a calculator project, outlining available functions and usage. Here's a review of the diff, pointing out potential bugs, mistakes, and suggestions:

### Bugs and Mistakes

1. **Incomplete Usage Example**: The usage example only demonstrates the `add` function. It would be beneficial to include examples for `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions as well.
2. **No Error Handling**: The `divide` function may raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the divisor is zero. It's essential to handle this edge case and provide a meaningful error message or alternative behavior.
3. **No Input Validation**: The functions do not validate their inputs. For instance, they assume that the inputs are numbers. Adding input validation can help prevent unexpected behavior or errors.

### Suggestions

1. **Add More Functions**: Consider adding more advanced arithmetic functions, such as exponentiation, square root, or modulus.
2. **Improve Code Organization**: If the calculator library is implemented in a separate file (e.g., `calculator.py`), consider adding a `__main__.py` file to serve as the entry point for the library.
3. **Include Example Use Cases**: Provide more example use cases in the `README.md` file to demonstrate the library's capabilities and usage.
4. **Consider Using a More Robust Documentation Format**: While Markdown is suitable for simple documentation, you may want to consider using a more robust format like reStructuredText or Sphinx for larger projects.
5. **Add Tests**: It's essential to include unit tests for the calculator functions to ensure their correctness and catch any regressions.

### Updated Usage Example

Here's an updated usage example that demonstrates all available functions:
```python
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

# Basic arithmetic operations
result_add = add(5, 3)  # Returns 8
result_subtract = subtract(10, 4)  # Returns 6
result_multiply = multiply(7, 2)  # Returns 14
result_divide = divide(9, 3)  # Returns 3.0

# Error handling example
try:
    result_divide_by_zero = divide(10, 0)
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
By addressing these points, you can improve the overall quality and usability of the calculator library.
