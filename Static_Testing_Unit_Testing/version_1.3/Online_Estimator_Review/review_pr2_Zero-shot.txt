Review of the GitHub Pull Request diff:

**Overall Observations:**

1. The pull request introduces several new files, including `README.md`, `auth.py`, `calculator_2.py`, `data_processor.py`, and `sort_algorithms.py`.
2. The code appears to be written in Python, and the files seem to be related to various mathematical and data processing tasks.
3. There are some formatting issues, such as missing newlines at the end of files.

**Bugs and Mistakes:**

1. **Insecure password storage:** In `auth.py`, the `login` function stores passwords in plain text, which is a significant security risk. Although the `secure_login` function uses hashing, it's still not recommended to store passwords in this way. Consider using a secure password hashing library like `bcrypt` or `argon2`.
2. **Missing error handling:** In `calculator_2.py`, the `divide` function raises a `ValueError` when dividing by zero, but it doesn't handle other potential errors, such as non-numeric inputs.
3. **Inconsistent naming conventions:** The code uses both camelCase and underscore notation for variable and function names. It's essential to stick to a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase.
4. **Unused code:** In `data_processor.py`, the `process_data` function is marked as "OLD" and "Inefficient," but it's still present in the codebase. Consider removing unused code to keep the repository clean.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Improve code organization:** Consider grouping related functions and classes into separate modules or packages to improve code organization and reusability.
2. **Add unit tests:** Writing unit tests can help ensure that the code is working correctly and catch any regressions introduced by future changes.
3. **Use type hints:** Adding type hints can improve code readability and help catch type-related errors.
4. **Consider using a linter:** A linter can help enforce coding standards and catch formatting issues, such as missing newlines at the end of files.
5. **Add documentation:** While the `README.md` file provides some information, consider adding more detailed documentation for each module or function to help users understand how to use the code.

**Specific Code Suggestions:**

1. In `calculator_2.py`, consider adding a `try`-`except` block to handle non-numeric inputs in the `divide` function.
2. In `data_processor.py`, consider removing the unused `process_data` function.
3. In `sort_algorithms.py`, consider adding a `main` function or example usage to demonstrate how to use the sorting algorithms.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured, but there are some areas that need improvement, such as security, error handling, and code organization. Addressing these issues can help make the code more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
